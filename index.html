      <span>Each of these dots is a death from vaccine preventable diseases. At least, 7,131 people died every day on average in 2017</span>
      <span>Almost two in five of them were children under 5 years old</span>
      <span>But this is just one day. Around 2.6 million died worldwide that year</span>
      <span>The number has halved since 1990, from 5 million, with much of the drop coming since 2000</span>
      <span>Pneumonia caused by the pneumococcus bacteria and rotavirus are the main causes of death</span>
      <span>Measles, Hib and tetanus have also killed millions, but the number dying has fallen substantially</span>
      <span>In recent years some vaccine preventable diseases have been on the rise</span>
      <span>Measles deaths, for example, have doubled in Europe in the last decade, from 86 to 193</span>
